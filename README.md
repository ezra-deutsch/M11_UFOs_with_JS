# UFOs_with_JS

### Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this challenge was to use JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to create an interactive webpage where users can see and filter data regarding UFO sightings. Dana has a JavaScript array of great data showing different aspects of many UFO sightings around North America. She would like to give the users a better experience by allowing them to filter the data on any or all five different variables; Date, City, State, Country, or Shape.

### Results

Dana's website was a great start to getting an eye catching and professional looking page. She asked us to add multiple criteria filters for her audience to slice the data across different variables. We added City, State, Country, and Shape to filter the data by. These filters work without a clickable button and simply filter the moment that an entry is recognized.

The filter functionality allows for multiple criteria to be filtered at the same time. See below the image for filters applied to both Date (1/1/2010) and Shape (triangle).

### Summary

This update to Dana's webpage makes for a much better user experience. Allowing the user to control what filter variables they want to search on allows for a lot more user engagement. One major drawback to the website is the limited content in the data array. Future developments required would be to continuously update the UFO sightings data array. Dana needs to keep updating the sightings data to keep users coming back to her page. Another development that Dana could embrace is visually mapping where these sighting are occurring. Users like pictures more than data tables. If the data array was stored as a clickable map, it would offer more user engagement.
